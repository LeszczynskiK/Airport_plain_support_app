# Airport_plain_support_app

This project is a theoretical  C++ and QT(QML) application designed to  
assist pilots at airports/air by providing real-time information about all flight condition.  
  
There are 3 pages:  
- Airport  
- In the air  
- After landing  
Each page is connected with own functionality to make pilot's life easier.  
  
Features:    
  
1. Airport Page:  
- Runway Availability Display: Indicates which runways are free or occupied  
- Takeoff Clearance Indicator: Notifies pilots when they are allowed to take off  
- Runway Guidance: Provides instructions on which runway to proceed to  
- Weather Conditions Display: Provides simulated weather information affecting flights  
  
2. In the Air Page  
- In-Flight Assistance: Displays altitude, speed, and heading information for pilots  
- Flight Path Guidance: Assists in maintaining the correct flight trajectory  
- Air Traffic Awareness: Simulates nearby aircraft positions to improve situational awareness  
  
3. After Landing Page  
- Parking Guidance: Provides directions to park terminals    
- Gate Assignment Notification: Informs pilots of the designated gate for parking    
- Post-Landing Checklist: Displays necessary actions after landing
